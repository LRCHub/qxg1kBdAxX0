Tell me a lie
I promise that I'll believe
Look me in the eye
I'm so easily deceived
What's the big deal, why make me feel
The cold creeping into my heart?
Whatever you do, spare me the truth
It'll only tear me apart

Tell me a lie
It wouldn't be your first
You won't even have to try
I know that you've told me worse
Would it be so wrong to just play along
And tell me what I'd like to hear?
You know that I know that you have to go
But you haven't left yet, my dear

Tell me a lie
But no matter what you say
Don't say goodbye
'Til we've gone our separate ways
