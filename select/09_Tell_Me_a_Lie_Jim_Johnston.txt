I've known you all my life
At least that's how it seems
Never known another way
Living out on a dream
Now I know you're leaving me and I'll never understand
Before I let you walk away, I have one last demand

Tell me a lie and say that you won't go
Look in my eyes and hold me even though
I realize you had to walk away
No more yesterday

You always were my angel
Flying high above
Always looking out for me
Angel that I love
But now my dreams are fadin like age-old photographs
That hurt too much to look at now, remind us of our past

Tell me a lie (Tell me a lie) and say that you won't go
Look in my eyes (Look in my eyes) and hold me even though
I realize you had to walk away
No more yesterday

Maybe we could stay together
Maybe it could last forever
Maybe if you just tell me a lie
Maybe then, we'll never say goodbye
