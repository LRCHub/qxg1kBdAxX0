Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try
And I've tried
Well I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired
As you break my heart
Again this time…
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your
distance distance
Tell me anything but don't you
say here's what you're
missing baby
If he's the reason that you’re
leaving me tonight
Spare me what you're thinking
Tell me a lie
Well you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time
And well there must've
been a time
I was the reason for that smile
So keep in mind
As you take what's left of
‘you & I’
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your
distance distance
Tell me anything but don't you
say here's what you're
missing baby
If he's the reason that you’re
leaving me tonight
Spare me what you're thinking
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
(Oh oh oh oh)
Tell me a lie
(Oh oh oh oh)
Tell me a lie
(Oh oh oh oh)
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your
distance distance
Tell me anything but don't you
say here's what you're
missing baby
If he's the reason that you’re
leaving me tonight
Spare me what you're thinking
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
