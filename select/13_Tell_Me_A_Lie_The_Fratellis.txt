AHHH AHHAAA AAAA... (x6)
Well, once I was persuaded to open up my head
I told about the was and when, count me wrong instead
I said, would you believe me, if you only knew
I been stealing never till this conversation soon
And the boy cried, hang number three
Saw him on the front page, laughing of me
He went in fair ground and a tall hat
'He's a liar!, he's a liar!'
A good one at that
Say what you wanna, Say what you will
Writes his number on my telephone bill
Wild like a monkey, kick like a mule
I could be a beggar, but I rather be, just as cool...
Aah, aah, aah, aaah
So I told him all I could about all could they expect
I lost my sense of smell and I gain my self-respect
They told me I was curious
I told them they where slow
They asked me where I can get that stuff
I told him I don't know
And the boy cried whopie-didi
There's a women with a mustache
Who won't let me be
She was born on the money
She a harmer in form
'She's a liar!, She's a liar!'
Like never been born
Say what you wanna, Say what you will
Writes his number on my telephone bill
Wild like a monkey, kick like a mule
I could be a beggar, but I rather be just as cool...
Ah, ah, ah, ah...ah, ah, ah, ah
And the boy cried, hang number three
Saw him on the front page, laughing of me
He went in fair ground and a tall hat
He's a liar!, He's a liar!
A good one at that
Say what you wanna, Say what you will
Writes his number on my telephone bill
Wild like a monkey, kick like a mule
I could be a beggar, but I rather be just as cool...
AHHH AHHAAA AAAA...(x6)
